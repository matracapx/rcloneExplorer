Installation
------------
Grab the [latest version](https://github.com/x0b/rcloneExplorer/releases/latest) of the signed APK and install it on your phone. Only devices running Android Lollipop 5.0 and up are supported. 

| CPU architecture | Where to find | APK identifier |
|:---|:--|:---:|
|ARM 32 Bit | older or low-cost devices | ```armeabi-v7a``` |
|ARM 64 Bit | most newer devices | ```arm64-v8a``` |
|x86 32 Bit | some TV boxes and tablets | ```x86``` |
|x86_64 | some emulators | ```x86_64``` |

If you don't know which version to pick use ```rcloneExplorer-<version>-universal-release.apk```. Most devices run ARM 64 Bit, and 64 Bit devices often can also run the respective 32 bit version at lower performance.

Usage
------------
[See the wiki](https://github.com/x0b/rcloneExplorer/wiki).
